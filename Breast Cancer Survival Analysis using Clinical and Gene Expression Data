🧬 Breast Cancer Survival Analysis using Clinical and Gene Expression Data
🔍 Project Overview
This project investigates how clinical features and gene expression patterns influence survival outcomes in breast cancer patients using the METABRIC dataset. I used Python, R, Excel, and Tableau to clean, 
analyze, and visualize the data, integrating statistical methods with biological context to generate actionable insights.

🎯 Goals
Identify clinical factors associated with breast cancer survival.

Explore the effect of gene expression (Z-score normalized) on patient outcomes.

Use logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to evaluate significant predictors.

📁 Dataset
Source: METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium)

Size: 1,980 breast cancer samples with clinical, genomic, and survival data

Key fields:

Clinical: Age, Tumor Stage, ER/PR/HER2 Status, Chemotherapy, Radiation

Genomic: Gene expression (Z-scores) for ~25,000 genes

Outcomes: Overall survival time and status

🛠️ Tools & Techniques
Task	                                      Tool
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing	              Excel, Python (Pandas)
Statistical Analysis	                      R (ANOVA, Tukey HSD, Logistic Regression, Survival Analysis)
Visualization	                              Tableau, Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib), R (ggplot2)
Bioinformatics Research	                    PubMed, NCBI Gene, GeneCards.org

📊 Clinical Factors & Survival
Correlation Analysis
Explored pairwise relationships among clinical features.

Found moderate correlations between:
ER Status & Chemotherapy (r = 0.46)
ER & PR Status (r = 0.53)
Death from Cancer & Age at Diagnosis (r = 0.39)

ER+/Chemotherapy Subgroup:
Logistic regression showed patients who were ER+ and received chemotherapy had higher odds of survival.
Created filtered tables and plots to support stratified analysis.

Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve
Compared ER+/PR+, ER+/PR−, ER−/PR+, and ER−/PR− subtypes.

No statistically significant difference in survival between groups, suggesting other variables may influence prognosis.

🧬 Gene Expression Analysis
Method
Selected genes with known roles in cancer:

AHNAK (tumor suppressor)
AURKA and CDC25A (oncogenes)
LAMA2 (extracellular matrix remodeling, potential tumor suppressor)

Split patients into overexpressed (Z > 2) and underexpressed (Z < -2) groups.
Conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and logistic regression.

Key Findings
Gene	                  Role	                                        Effect on Survival	                                      Notes
AHNAK	               Tumor Suppressor	                            Higher expression = ↑ survival	                    Not statistically significant
AURKA	                 Oncogene	                                  Higher expression = ↓ survival	                            Significant
CDC25A	               Oncogene	                                  Higher expression = ↓ survival	                            Significant
LAMA2	             Potential Tumor Suppressor	                    Higher expression = ↑ survival	                          Not significant

📌 Logistic regression confirmed AURKA and CDC25A as significant predictors of poor survival in breast cancer.

🧠 Insights
Integrating clinical and molecular data enhances understanding of breast cancer survival.
AURKA and CDC25A may be promising therapeutic targets.
Personalized treatment strategies should consider both hormone receptor status and oncogene expression.

📌 Future Work
Multivariate survival models combining gene + clinical features
Compare METABRIC with TCGA-BRCA dataset
Build interactive dashboards (e.g., Streamlit or Shiny)
